# Discrete-event simulation (DES) models

> ⭐ **Relevant experience to STARS:**
> * **DES models** (some experience working on code for DES model)
> * **R packages** (WP1, restructuring into reproducible software package)

## Example: Contributions on IPACS

In **March and April 2023**, I spent a little bit of time with Alison, **contributing to the DES model on IPACS** (Improving Patient flow between Acute, Community and Social care).

### Final model

Working through the code for the IPACS model, **rewriting and simplifying to improve clarity, adding comments and docstrings, and identifying and fixing bugs**, [as detailed here](https://github.com/AliHarp/IPACS_MODEL). This contributed to the final repository hosted with [NHS BNSSG Analytics](https://github.com/nhs-bnssg-analytics/ipacs-model):

### Example package

I also had a bit of time in which I was able to make an example of the conversion of part of the model (visit-based simulation) into an R package, as in [this repository](https://github.com/amyheather/ipacs):

This is supported by a website that provides an overview of how to run the model, and information about functions:
